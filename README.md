# Simulation-and-dimension-reduction-of-shotgun-metagenome-data
This repository contains all scripts, documents and information related to the Master's thesis "Simulation and dimension reduction of shotgun metagenome data". The thesis is available at (coming later).

## Important Note on Sensitive Information

To ensure the security and privacy of the data involved in this project, all sensitive information has been removed from the scripts and other files in this repository. This includes, but is not limited to, sample IDs and complete paths. Additionally, some directroies may be empty due to sensitive information. 

### Access Requirements

To run the scripts contained in this repository, you must have authorized access to the project on the Tjenester for Sensitive Data (TSD) platform. TSD provides a secure environment for processing sensitive data, which is crucial for our research.
